    "Welcome to \"***Car Price Prediction Project***\". This is the first medium project of ***Machine Learning*** course. In this project you will have the opportunity to apply many algorithms commonly used for regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you will apply various processes such as pre-processing, ***train-test spilit*** and ***cross validation*** that you will use in algorithm modeling and prediction processes in Python with ***scikit-learn***. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the project, please take a look at the determines and tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOTE:** This project assumes that you already know the basics of coding in Python. You should also be familiar with the theory behind regression algorithms and scikit-learn module as well as Machine Learning before you begin.\n"

    "**Auto Scout** data which using for this project, scraped from the on-line car trading company(https://www.autoscout24.com)in 2019, contains many features of 9 different car models. In this project, you will use the data set which is already preprocessed and prepared for algorithms .\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Senario, you will estimate the prices of cars using regression algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "While starting you should import the necessary modules and load the data given as pkl file. Also you'll need to do a few pre-processing before moving to modelling. After that you will implement ***Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression,and Elastic-Net algorithms respectively*** (After completion of Unsupervised Learning section, you can also add bagging and boosting algorithms such as ***Random Forest and XG Boost*** this notebook to develop the project). You can measure the success of your models with regression evaluation metrics as well as with cross validation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the better results, you should try to increase the success of your models by performing hyperparameter tuning. Determine feature importances for the model. You can set your model with the most important features for resource saving. You should try to apply this especially in Random Forest and XG Boost algorithms. Unlike the others, you will perform hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest and XG Boost using the ***GridSearchCV*** method. \n",
