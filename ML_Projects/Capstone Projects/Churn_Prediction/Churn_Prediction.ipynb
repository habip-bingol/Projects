    "\n",
    "You will be able to implement classification techniques in Python. Using Scikit-Learn allowing you to successfully make predictions with Distance Based, Bagging, Boosting algorithms for this project. On the other hand, for Deep Learning you will use Tensorflow-Keras. \n",

    "At the end of the project, you will have the opportunity to deploy your model using *Streamlit*.\n",

    "The HR dataset has 14,999 samples. In the given dataset, you have two types of employee one who stayed and another who left the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can describe 10 attributes in detail as:\n",
    "- ***satisfaction_level:*** It is employee satisfaction point, which ranges from 0-1.\n",
    "- ***last_evaluation:*** It is evaluated performance by the employer, which also ranges from 0-1.\n",
    "- ***number_projects:*** How many of projects assigned to an employee?\n",
    "- ***average_monthly_hours:*** How many hours in averega an employee worked in a month?\n",
    "- **time_spent_company:** time_spent_company means employee experience. The number of years spent by an employee in the company.\n",
    "- ***work_accident:*** Whether an employee has had a work accident or not.\n",
    "- ***promotion_last_5years:*** Whether an employee has had a promotion in the last 5 years or not.\n",
    "- ***Departments:*** Employee's working department/division.\n",
    "- ***Salary:*** Salary level of the employee such as low, medium and high.\n",
    "- ***left:*** Whether the employee has left the company or not.\n",

    "First of all, to observe the structure of the data, outliers, missing values and features that affect the target variable, you must use exploratory data analysis and data visualization techniques. \n",

    "The purpose of clustering analysis is to cluster data with similar characteristics. You are asked to use the ***K-means*** algorithm to make cluster analysis. However, you must provide the K-means algorithm with information about the number of clusters it will make predictions. Also, the data you apply to the K-means algorithm must be scaled. In order to find the optimal number of clusters, you are asked to use the ***Elbow method***. Briefly, try to predict the set to which individuals are related by using K-means and evaluate the estimation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is ready to be applied to the model, you must ***split the data into train and test***. Then build a model to predict whether employees will churn or not. Train your models with your train set, test the success of your model with your test set. \n",

    "Try to make your predictions by using the algorithms ***Logistic Regression***, ***Random Forest Classifier***, ***XGBoost Classifier***, ***ANN***. You can use the related modules of the ***scikit-learn*** and ***Tensorflow-Keras*** library. You can use scikit-learn ***Classification Metrics*** module for accuracy calculation. You can use the ***Yellowbrick*** module for model selection and visualization.\n",

    "#### Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to feature scaling while others are virtually invariant to it. Machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, etc. that use gradient descent as an optimization technique require data to be scaled. Also distance algorithms like KNN, K-means, and SVM are most affected by the range of features. This is because behind the scenes they are using distances between data points to determine their similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling Types:\n",
    "- Normalization: Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. It is also known as Min-Max scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardization: Standardization is another scaling technique where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation.\n",

The elbow method plots the value of the cost function produced by different values of k. If k increases, average distortion will decrease, each cluster will have fewer constituent instances, and the instances will be closer to their respective centroids. However, the improvements in average distortion will decline as k increases. The value of k at which improvement in distortion declines the most is called the elbow, at which we should stop dividing the data into further clusters.\n",
